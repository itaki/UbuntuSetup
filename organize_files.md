# File Organization Script Documentation

## Purpose
This script organizes loose files in the UbuntuSetup repository into their appropriate directories based on their function and purpose.

## Actions Performed
1. Creates necessary directories if they don't exist:
   - `system_config/` - For system configuration files
   - `ml_setup/` - For machine learning setup files
   - `assets/` - For resource files

2. Moves files to their appropriate locations:
   - System Configuration:
     - `conky.conf` → `system_config/`
   
   - Machine Learning Setup:
     - `setup_ml_environment.sh` → `ml_setup/`
     - `accelerate_config.yaml` → `ml_setup/`
     - `cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb` → `ml_setup/`
     - `get-pip.py` → `ml_setup/`
   
   - Assets:
     - `mountain.png` → `assets/`

3. Cleans up by removing any empty directories

## Usage
```bash
chmod +x organize_files.sh
./organize_files.sh
```

## Note
This script is intended to be run once to organize the initial repository structure. After running this script, new files should be placed directly in their appropriate directories.
